Calculate Discount - Python Quiz

Description
This quiz involves creating a Python function named calculate_discount that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The function will:

Accept two parameters: the original price of the item (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent).
Apply the discount if the percentage is 20% or higher.
Return the original price if the discount is less than 20%.
The user will be prompted to input the original price and discount percentage, and the final price (after the discount, if applicable) will be displayed.

Features
Discount Calculation: Automatically applies discounts of 20% or higher.
Original Price Return: If the discount is less than 20%, the original price will be returned without changes.
User Input: The user is prompted to enter the original price and the discount percentage.
How It Works
The user inputs the original price of the item.
The user inputs the discount percentage.
The program checks if the discount percentage is 20% or more:
If yes, the discount is applied, and the final price is calculated and displayed.
If no, the original price is returned and displayed.

Example 1.

Enter the original price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price: 75.0


Example 2.

Enter the original price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 10
Final price: 100.0
